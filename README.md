## Research Problem
### Climate Change
Climate change is affecting our bodies of water: an important source from where we get and use our water. Global warming  has increased the average water temperature of rivers and oceans, acidifying the water, increasing the prevalence of diseases, and affecting the ecosystem for many organisms, which are fundamental for our direct and indirect food sources. This affects the way of life of humans in terms of diseases, increased natural phenomena, and an impacted food chain/source. 

## Research Goal
Marine organisms have evolved over billions of years to naturally and swiftly move through water. One way to optimize underwater robots is to utilize features and characteristics from marine organisms. The goal of this research project is to create an underwater robot that leverages bio-inspired and bio-mimetic features derived from aquatic organisms.

# Research Plan
Our group is designing an underwater robot that releases an alkalinity enhancement substance to increase the ocean's carbon sink. Our robot will mimic the features of a Sandbar shark, an animal that is particularly known to travel near the sandbars of bodies of water, making it particularly useful for our use case in efficiently deploying the substance.
