## Research Problem
### Climate Change
Climate change is affecting our bodies of water: an important source from where we get and use our water. Global warming  has increased the average water temperature of rivers and oceans, acidifying the water, increasing the prevalence of diseases, and affecting the ecosystem for many organisms, which are fundamental for our direct and indirect food sources. This affects the way of life of humans in terms of diseases, increased natural phenomena, and an impacted food chain/source.
